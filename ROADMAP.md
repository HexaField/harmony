## Deployment Targets

| Target           | Description                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Electron**     | Desktop app — embedded `server-runtime` in main process, `ui-app` in BrowserWindow renderer |
| **Local Server** | Self-hosted `server-runtime` daemon (SQLite-backed), Docker distribution                    |
| **Web UI**       | Browser SPA — same `ui-app` build, connects to cloud or self-hosted server                  |
| **Portal**       | `portal-worker` on Cloudflare (D1, R2, KV) — identity, directory, invite, OAuth             |
| **Cloud Server** | `cloud-worker` — Durable Objects (one per community), DO SQLite, Hibernatable WS            |
| **Mobile**       | Capacitor (Android) + PWA — same `ui-app` build                                             |

> **Important:** Electron, Web UI, and Mobile all share the same SolidJS `ui-app` renderer. All UI features (message views, DMs, threads, search, voice controls, migration wizard, etc.) are available across all three. The columns below mark features as ➖ only where the feature genuinely does not apply to that target (e.g. PWA service worker doesn't apply to Electron, file-based config doesn't apply to browser).

### E2EE (End-to-End Encryption)

| Feature                                     | Lib | Server | UI  |
| ------------------------------------------- | --- | ------ | --- |
| MLS group creation + key package exchange   | ✅  | ✅     | ✅  |
| MLS welcome/commit messages                 | ✅  | ✅     | ✅  |
| MLS auto member addition                    | ✅  | ✅     | ✅  |
| MLS key exchange between members            | ✅  | ✅     | ✅  |
| Always-on MLS (no toggle)                   | ✅  | ✅     | ✅  |
| DM encryption (XChaCha20-Poly1305 + X25519) | ✅  | ✅     | ✅  |
| E2EE re-keying on member revocation         | ❌  | ❌     | ❌  |

> **MLS E2EE is fully operational** for channel messages. Key exchange happens automatically when members join communities — the group creator adds new members via MLS Welcome messages. Epoch synchronization, deduplication, and pending message queuing all verified in both unit tests (88 e2ee, 34 key-exchange) and browser E2E tests (Playwright Topology 2 + CDP browser test). DM encryption (X25519 + XChaCha20-Poly1305) also works correctly. Remaining: epoch history for decrypting old messages, MLS group creation for newly-created channels after initial setup, and re-keying on member revocation.

- VoiceClient `debugState()` method for E2E testing introspection
- `fireVoiceSignal` (fire-and-forget) vs `sendVoiceSignal` (request-response) pattern
- Voice signaling fix: `onVoiceSignal` emitter listener for server-push messages
- Electron builds: macOS arm64 DMG (195MB) + Linux x64 AppImage (192MB)
- Merged FEATURES.md back into ROADMAP.md (single source of truth)
- Robust media lifecycle: mute/video/screenshare all fully stop (close producer + stop tracks) not just pause
- `voice.producer-closed` server broadcast: remote clients tear down matching consumers + fire `onTrackRemoved`
- Self-consumption prevention: `getProducers` excludes requester's own producers, skips closed producers
- Cross-device speaking indicators: AnalyserNode → `voice.speaking` signal → server relay → remote store
- Deafen wired: `setDeafened()` pauses/resumes all consumers, auto-mutes on deafen
- `onTrackRemoved` callback: VideoGrid removes tiles when producer-closed arrives
- VideoGrid callback leak fixed: registered once per session via `callbacksRegistered` flag
- Full member list sync on reconnect: `community.info.response` with display names sent during `resyncMemberships`
- Store init race fix: replays client's internal `_communities` Map for pre-mount auto-joined communities
- Real-time presence updates: `presence` event listener in store + server broadcasts `presence.changed` during resync
- `getMembersWithDisplayNames()` helper extracted for DRY member resolution (RDF store → display names + online status)
- Message edit decryption: `handleChannelMessageUpdated` decrypts ciphertext before emitting `message.edited`
- DM multi-server routing: non-community messages sent to ALL connected servers (was first-only, missing cross-server recipients)
- Optimistic DM tracking: sender's store records outgoing DMs under peer DID key
- Channel lifecycle events in store: `channel.created`, `channel.updated`, `channel.deleted` listeners added
- **51-test cross-device E2E suite** (`harmony-flows.cjs`): messaging, edit/delete, reactions, channel CRUD, voice, DMs, typing, threads, pins, roles, presence — all green on Mac+Linux

### 2026-02-28 → 2026-03-01

- 101 new unit tests: DM routing, message edits, voice lifecycle, channel events, adapter contracts
- Message edit/delete self-echo prevention: server-side `conn.id` exclude + client-side sender guard
- DM architecture documented: `docs/dm-architecture.md` (relay-based E2EE, 4-phase sovereignty roadmap)
- Cross-topology Playwright E2E suite: 31 passing across 4 topologies (single client, two clients, self-hosted, mixed)
- MLS encryption diagnosed and disabled: independent MLS groups per client can't decrypt each other — plaintext passthrough until key exchange implemented
- Store `community.updated` listener: picks up new communities from `createCommunity`
- Local `message` emit in `sendMessage`: server excludes sender from broadcast, local emit needed for optimistic updates
- `HarmonyClient.toBytes()` static helper: handles `Uint8Array`, `Array`, and `Record<string, number>` ciphertext forms
- `handleSyncResponse` updated to use `toBytes()` for consistent array-format ciphertext handling
- Fixed `encryptForChannel` serialisation: `Array.from(plaintext)` instead of raw `Uint8Array` (JSON round-trip produces object, not array)
- Edit/delete events now include `channelId` (headless Playwright has no `activeChannelId()`)
- Port conflict fix: test servers use even base ports with +10 spacing (health endpoint uses port+1)
- Discord mock E2E suite: 48 Playwright tests covering Bot REST API, OAuth flow, DiscordLinkService, MigrationBot export, Portal identity & friends — all with mock HTTP server using real Discord API v10 data shapes
- Vitest count: 2,534 passing (was 2,433). Playwright count: 79 passing + 7 skipped (was 13)
- All commits pushed to origin/main

### 2026-03-01

- MLS key exchange fully operational: creator adds members via Welcome, epoch sync verified
- MLS dedup fix: `_pendingMemberDIDs` Map on client prevents duplicate `addMember` when multiple `mls.member.joined` notifications arrive before async add completes
- Server MLS logging: `[MLS-KP-UPLOAD]`, `[MLS-COMM-JOIN]`, `[MLS-GROUP-SETUP]`, `[MLS-NOTIFY]`, `[MLS-DEDUP]`
- Client MLS logging: `[MLS-DECRYPT-FAIL]` with epoch/senderIndex/ctLen
- Encryption key pair persistence in `PersistedState` — survives reconnects
- `joinFromWelcome` signature fix: separate encryption (X25519) and signing (Ed25519) key pairs
- `processCommit` epoch guard: `commit.epoch <= current` → skip (prevents Welcome+Commit double-apply)
- Pending MLS message queue: messages before Welcome stored in `_pendingMlsMessages`, replayed after
- Sequential member addition queue: `_pendingMemberAdds` prevents racing on keypackage.response
- `handleChannelMessage` rewritten: epoch 0 = plaintext, epoch >0 = MLS decrypt, regex validation for printable text
- 34 new MLS key exchange tests (`packages/e2ee/test/mls-key-exchange.spec.ts`) — all passing
- 88/88 e2ee tests passing (was 54)
- Vitest total: 2,565 (was 2,534)
- Manual browser MLS verification: Alice+Bob same epoch, decrypt confirmed via CDP
- Repo cleanup: `dist-electron/` removed from git + added to `.gitignore`, test scripts moved to `tests/scripts/`
- Beta polish B1–B5 implemented and **visually verified via CDP browser automation**:
  - B1: Channel unread badges (count + bold name, auto-clear on switch)
  - B2: Notification sounds (Web Audio API 880→660Hz chime)
  - B3: Markdown renderer rewrite (bold, italic, code, strikethrough, spoiler, links, mentions, blockquotes, lists, code blocks, headings)
  - B4: @mention rendering with accent highlight
  - B5: Debug logs → `console.debug` (16 statements across server/client/voice/UI)
- TS fixes: voice transport/produce/consume message types, voice event types, `EventHandler` type, duplicate export, unused import — 0 errors across client/server/ui-app
- `PENTEST-RESULTS.md` deleted — all 11 findings remediated, tracked in security section
- App.tsx: silent `catch {}` blocks now log `console.error("[App] init error:")` — was hiding identity init failures
- Superseded CDP test scripts deleted; voice + MLS scripts kept in `tests/scripts/`
- Beta polish B7–B12 completed:
  - B7: Document title `(count) Harmony` + canvas favicon badge (red circle with count, caps at 99+)
  - B8: Full emoji picker (7 categories, 350+ emoji, search, shortcode resolution `:fire:` → 🔥)
  - B9/B10/B12: Already implemented (confirmed via visual verification)
  - B11: Member profile popover on author name click (avatar, DID, status, role badges)
- 11 new unit tests (emoji shortcode resolution, document title logic, unread count aggregation)
- All B1–B12 items visually verified in browser via CDP automation

## Beta Polish — Must Fix & Should Fix

> Items identified from a full codebase sweep (2026-03-01). Must-fix items are things users will notice immediately as broken; should-fix items are polish that sets the tone for a quality product.

### 🔴 Must Fix

| # | Item | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B1 | Channel unread indicators | ✅ | Sidebar has no unread badges or bold for channels. DM unreads exist; channels don't. |
| B2 | Notification sounds | ✅ | Zero audio feedback for messages, mentions, or DMs. Silent app feels broken. |
| B3 | Markdown renderer (inline) | ✅ | Line-level only — can't handle `**bold** and *italic*` in same line. No multi-line code blocks, blockquotes, or lists. |
| B4 | @mention rendering in messages | ✅ | Detected server-side for notifications but not highlighted/clickable in message view. |
| B5 | Remove debug console.log statements | ✅ | 16 debug logs in server (`[MLS-*]`, `[resync]`) and client (`[MLS]`, `[Voice]`, `[Migration]`). Behind debug flag or remove. |
| B6 | Social recovery UI stubs | ✅ | Setup wired to `IdentityManager.setupRecovery()` with validation + localStorage persistence. Approve/status/complete show "coming in a future update" (requires server relay). |

### 🟡 Should Fix

| # | Item | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B7 | Favicon badge / document title unread | ✅ | `(count) Harmony` in document title + canvas-drawn favicon badge with red circle + count. |
| B8 | Emoji picker for message compose | ✅ | Full categorized picker (7 categories, 350+ emoji), search, shortcode resolution (`:fire:` → 🔥). |
| B9 | Italic/spoiler/link not rendered | ✅ | Already implemented in B3 MarkdownRenderer rewrite — all inline types render in MessageArea. |
| B10 | Image lightbox on click | ✅ | Already wired — `setLightboxSrc(attachment.url)` on image click, full-screen overlay with dismiss. |
| B11 | Member profile popover | ✅ | Click author name → popover with avatar, DID, status, role badges. Dismiss on click-outside. |
| B12 | Channel topic in header | ✅ | Already implemented in MainLayout — shows `  topic` next to channel name when present. |

## Post-Launch

### Priority 1 — Should ship soon after launch

- **Multi-level ZCAP delegation** — Admin → Mod → Temp-Mod chains, attenuation at each level
- **VC-based admission** — Gate `community.join` on required credentials
- **Code block syntax highlighting** — Add `highlight.js` or `shiki` to message renderer
- **Rich embeds** — Render link previews inline in messages
- **Contact list persistence** — Friends list storage

### Voice Production Hardening

- **WASM encryption** — Rust-WASM for AES-GCM frame encryption (performance over JS)
- **TURN/STUN** — CF global TURN for restrictive NATs
- **DO location hints** — `locationHint` set to majority-participant region
- **Voice analytics** — Workers Analytics Engine for "Time to First Frame"
- **Simulcast** — VP8 simulcast layers (high/medium/low), SFU selects per subscriber
- **Mesh fallback** — If CF SFU unavailable, degrade to P2P mesh (post-launch)

### Priority 2 — Important but not urgent

- **Time/rate-limited capabilities** — Enforce expiry and rate caveats on ZCAPs
- **E2EE re-keying on member revocation** — MLS epoch rotation when member leaves/banned
- **E2EE key binding in VCs** — Embed X25519 public key in membership VC
- **User-to-user delegation** — Members delegate capabilities without admin
- **Credential UI wiring** — Wire portfolio/detail/issue/editor components to live data
- **Custom credential types** — Admin-defined VC types per community

### Priority 3 — Post-stabilization

- **Federation** — Server-to-server WebSocket, peer discovery, cross-server relay, federation ZCAPs
- **Governance** — Wire proposal/voting/constitution engine to server + UI
- **Bot API production** — Per-channel scoping, restart with backoff, ZCAP auth
- **AI agent ZCAPs** — Agent DIDs + constrained scope templates
- **GDPR tooling** — Member opt-out, privacy notices, personal data export
- **DID method expansion** — `did:web`, `did:plc`, plugin architecture
- **Community export/import** — `.hbundle` format, CLI commands, desktop UI
- **Revenue** — Custom domains, SSO, enterprise features, admin dashboard

## Post-Beta: Future Work

### Social Recovery Server Relay

B6 wired the client-side setup and initiation flows, but three operations require a server relay that doesn't exist yet:

1. **Approve** — Trustees need to receive recovery requests from the server, review them, and sign approvals. Requires:
   - Server endpoint: `POST /recovery/approve` — receives signed approval from trustee
   - Server endpoint: `GET /recovery/:requestId/status` — returns approval count vs threshold
   - Push notification to trustees when a recovery request is created for their DID
   - Protocol message types: `recovery.request`, `recovery.approve`, `recovery.status`

2. **Status Check** — Recoverer needs to poll (or subscribe to) approval progress. Requires:
   - Server aggregates approvals per request ID
   - WebSocket event: `recovery.status.updated` when new approval arrives

3. **Complete** — Once threshold is met, server verifies all approval signatures and issues new credentials. Requires:
   - Server endpoint: `POST /recovery/complete` — verifies approval signatures against trusted DID list
   - Re-key identity: generate new key pair, update DID document
   - Migrate community memberships to new DID
   - Invalidate old key packages, upload new ones

**Current state:** Setup persists to localStorage, initiation creates a local request ID. UI shows honest "coming in a future update" for server-dependent features.

### MLS Encryption

- **New channel MLS setup:** When channels are created after initial community join, the MLS group needs to be initialised for that channel. Currently only works for channels that exist at community join time.
- **Epoch history tracking:** Store past epoch secrets so old messages in sync history remain decryptable. Currently, messages encrypted under a previous epoch are unreadable after key rotation.
- **Re-keying on member removal:** When a member is removed/banned, rotate the MLS group key so they can't decrypt future messages. The `processCommit` epoch guard handles forward security but the removal flow isn't wired.

### Voice/Video

- Replace DID strings with display names in VideoGrid participant labels
- Add call state UI (connecting/disconnected/reconnecting indicators)
- Replace emoji icons with SVG icons in voice/video controls
- Mac VideoGrid `readyState:0` timing — verify `onunmute` fix with real media tracks
- Picture-in-Picture mode for voice calls

### Infrastructure (Release Gates)

- Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects deployment
- Domain registration + DNS
- Stripe API keys for billing
- macOS/Windows code signing certificates for Electron distribution
- Auto-update (electron-updater) configuration

### Known Limitations & Tracked Stubs

Items identified in audit rounds 1–3 that are documented but not yet fixed:

| Area | Issue | Severity | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MLS commit verification | `processCommit` does not verify commit signatures — forged commits accepted | Medium | Acceptable for simplified MLS; full TreeKEM would fix |
| MLS `updateKeys` | Uses raw random bytes as public key (no X25519 derivation) | Low | Works for symmetric key agreement; not standard MLS |
| VC/ZCAP revocation auth | Revoker key pair accepted but not verified against issuer | Medium | Server access control is enforcement layer; TODO tracked in code |
| Identity `completeRecovery` | Discards all credentials/capabilities on recovery | Medium | Post-beta: recovery should preserve attestation chain |
| Identity `createFromOAuthRecovery` | Derives DID from ephemeral token — new DID each time | Medium | Post-beta: needs stable OAuth-to-DID binding |
| Bot-api webhook HMAC | XOR hash instead of SHA-256 HMAC | Low | Package is 📋 (post-launch) |
| Bot-api lifecycle | `startBot`/`stopBot` are status flags only, no sandbox | Low | Package is 📋 (post-launch) |
| Cloud-worker `VoiceRoomDO` | Dead code — never imported | Low | Cleanup before cloud deployment |
| Portal OAuth URL | Hardcoded `oauth.example.com` placeholder | Low | Will be configured at deployment |
| Rate limit `clearRateLimits` | Empty function body | Low | Cloud middleware cleanup |
| App stubs | `checkForUpdates`, `reconnect`, `handleFileDrop`, `joinVoice` return hardcoded values | Low | Electron app convenience stubs; real logic in client/voice packages |
| Server-runtime JWT secret | Derived from `'***' + identityDID` — predictable | Medium | Must be configurable before production |
| Server-runtime logger `child()` | Mutates parent logger's `baseMeta` | Low | Logic bug, fix before production |
