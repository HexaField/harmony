# Harmony — Remaining Work

_Updated 2026-02-27. Canonical source for code-level work. Strategy/deployment in `membranes/harmony/plans/beta-release-todo.md`._

---

## ~~MVP Blockers (Batch 1)~~ ✅ All Done (2026-02-26)

- ~~Docker Compose~~ ✅ — Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, .env.example, harmony.config.example.yaml
- ~~Electron Packaging~~ ✅ — electron-builder.yml, macOS/Windows/Linux targets
- ~~Ban Enforcement~~ ✅ — Server-side ban list, ban/unban handlers, 6 new tests
- ~~PWA Icons~~ ✅ — Purple hexagon SVG, manifest + favicon
- ~~GUIDE.md Audit~~ ✅ — Threads/export marked "Coming soon", voice/docker/downloads caveated

## ~~E2EE~~ ✅ All Done (2026-02-26)

- ~~Server-side MLS key exchange~~ ✅ — Group creation, key package exchange, auto member addition, 11 integration tests
- ~~Always-on E2EE~~ ✅ — Removed `enableE2EE()` toggle, MLS + DM providers auto-created in every client
- ~~DM encryption~~ ✅ — X25519 key exchange, XChaCha20-Poly1305, auto-negotiated on first DM, 6 integration tests

## ~~Threads~~ ✅ Done (2026-02-26)

## ~~Social Recovery~~ ✅ Done (2026-02-26)

## ~~Mobile~~ ✅ Done (2026-02-26)

## ~~Pre-Launch (Batch 2)~~ ✅ All Done (2026-02-26)

- ~~ZCAP Verification~~ ✅ — real chain verification, capability store, DID resolution
- ~~Media Upload & File Sharing~~ ✅ — server handlers, client methods, UI components
- ~~Role Management~~ ✅ — CRUD, admin enforcement, permission system, events
- ~~Channel Pins~~ ✅ — protocol, server, client, 50-pin limit
- ~~Voice, Video & Screen Sharing~~ ✅ — protocol, server, client, E2EE bridge, UI

---

## ~~Tech Debt Batch~~ ✅ Done (2026-02-27)

- ~~TypeScript errors~~ ✅ — resolved all ~4525 errors across monorepo, `pnpm run check` passes (0 errors, 128 warnings)
- ~~Dockerfile cleanup~~ ✅ — deleted `Dockerfile.ui` and `Dockerfile.bot` (only `Dockerfile.server` ships)
- ~~CI prep~~ ✅ — disabled with `if: false`, ready to re-enable; Playwright refs noted for removal
- ~~Skip→Todo conversion~~ ✅ — 25 tests converted from `.skip()` to `.todo()` with descriptive reasons across wire-up, credentials, media, voice, cloud-worker
- ~~Post-launch labelling~~ ✅ — federation & bot-api tests marked "(post-launch)"
- ~~Docs~~ ✅ — RUNBOOK.md (361 LOC), MIGRATION-STRATEGY.md (290 LOC), FEATURES.md updated

## ~~Full-Text Search~~ ✅ Done (2026-02-27)

Search integration fully wired across client, server, and UI (commit `2425add`):

- ~~Wire `ClientSearchIndex` into client~~ ✅ — indexes messages after E2EE decrypt on receive
- ~~Wire `MetadataIndex` into server~~ ✅ — replaced brute-force `string.includes()` in `MessageStore.search()`
- ~~`search.query` handler~~ ✅ — server returns metadata results, client merges with FTS
- ~~Persist `ClientSearchIndex`~~ ✅ — serialization/deserialization support added to client-index.ts
- ~~Wire `SearchOverlay` UI~~ ✅ — store.tsx updated with search integration
- ~~E2EE constraint~~ ✅ — server searches metadata only, full-text is client-side

Tests: 39 passing (up from 35), 4 todo remaining (UI integration tests needing SolidJS context).

## Launch Requirements (Code Work)

### 2. Discord Migration — Manual Verification

Full pipeline exists and is mostly/completely working. Code may be complete — needs manual verification.

- [ ] Manual end-to-end: run `migration-bot` against a real Discord server
- [ ] Verify channel/message/role/member mapping completeness
- [ ] Verify media attachment migration
- [ ] Confirm UI flow in browser (migration-client → server endpoint → community creation)
- [ ] Migration data transforms: emoji, sticker, thread handling (3 todo tests in `migration.spec.ts`)

Files:

- `packages/migration-bot/` — Discord API integration
- `packages/migration/` — export parser, data transform, encryption
- `packages/ui-app/src/migration-client.ts` — UI client
- `packages/server-runtime/src/migration-endpoint.ts` — server endpoint

### 3. Security Hardening (code-level)

- [x] Message size limits on WebSocket ✅ — server rejects oversized messages (tests in server.spec.ts)
- [x] Input validation: malformed messages ✅ — server rejects missing type/communityId (tests in server.spec.ts)
- [ ] Input validation audit: all remaining WS message handlers in `packages/server/src/index.ts`
- [ ] Input validation: all REST endpoints in `packages/portal/src/routes/`
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation — verify it works under sustained load
- [ ] ZCAP privilege escalation tests — craft delegations with widened scope
- [ ] Media upload: verify no path traversal, content-type spoofing (R2 storage)
- [ ] `pnpm audit` — check for known CVEs in dependencies
- [ ] Cloud Worker DO isolation — verify no cross-community data access

### 4. Wrangler Configs — Real Resource IDs

- [ ] `packages/cloud-worker/wrangler.toml` — `database_id = "placeholder"` needs real CF D1 ID
- [ ] Add `[env.dev]`, `[env.staging]`, `[env.production]` sections to cloud-worker wrangler.toml
- [ ] `packages/portal-worker/` — real D1/R2/KV bindings for dev/staging/prod
- [ ] Secrets management: VP signing keys, DISCORD_CLIENT_ID, etc.

### 5. Environment Config

- [ ] Create `.env.dev`, `.env.staging`, `.env.production` (currently only `.env.example`)
- [ ] Document required env vars per deployment target (cloud vs self-hosted)

### 6. CI Pipeline

- [ ] Re-enable GitHub Actions (`if: false` currently)
- [x] CI Node version noted ✅ — needs 22→24 update for native modules
- [ ] Remove Playwright references if not needed for unit/integration tests

### 7. Billing Integration

- [ ] Stripe usage-based billing for cloud communities
- [ ] Plan exists at workspace `membranes/harmony/plans/billing-plan.md`
- [ ] Feature gating per tier (storage limits, history depth)

### 8. ~~Build System & Cleanup~~ ✅ Mostly Done

- [x] Deleted `packages/docker/Dockerfile.ui` and `packages/docker/Dockerfile.bot` ✅
- [ ] Consider pre-compilation for server packages in Docker image (faster cold start)
- [ ] Packages consumed as TS source via `tsx` — only `ui-app` has a real Vite build

### 9. Electron & Capacitor Build Pipelines

- [ ] Electron: macOS notarization, Windows Authenticode signing, auto-update
- [ ] Capacitor: Android APK signing (currently 3.7MB unsigned), iOS provisioning

### 10. Error Handling & Polish

- [ ] Network offline indicator in UI
- [ ] Graceful reconnection feedback (not just silent reconnect)
- [ ] Server connection drop mid-message — define behavior

---

## Post-Launch

### Federation

Protocol + `FederationManager` exist (319 LOC) but servers can't discover or relay to each other.

- [ ] Server-to-server WebSocket connection
- [ ] Peer discovery mechanism
- [ ] Cross-server message relay
- [ ] Trust model decisions (allow-list? open?)
- [ ] Federation ZCAPs — instance-to-instance capability delegation

### Bot API

`@harmony/bot-api` package exists. All skipped tests marked "(post-launch)".

- [ ] Per-channel scoping
- [ ] Automatic restart with backoff
- [ ] Inbound webhook rate limiting
- [ ] ZCAP epoch re-verification

### Multi-Level ZCAP Delegation

Single-level delegation works (admin → member). Plan specifies deep chains.

- [ ] Admin → Mod → Temp-Mod delegation chains
- [ ] Attenuation enforcement at each level
- [ ] Time-limited capabilities (expiry)
- [ ] Rate-limited capabilities (caveats)
- [ ] User-to-user delegation ("holiday mod")
- [ ] AI agent ZCAPs (scoped agent authorization)

### VC Enhancements

- [ ] E2EE key binding in membership VCs
- [ ] E2EE re-keying on member revocation/ban
- [ ] VC-based admission policies (gate on credential requirements)
- [ ] Cross-community trust networks
- [x] Rich VC portfolio UI — tests implemented 2026-02-27
- [ ] Custom credential types per community

### Community Export/Import

- [ ] Define .hbundle format (encrypted archive of quads + media)
- [ ] CLI `community export` / `community import` commands
- [ ] Desktop UI for export/import

### Friend Finding — Polish

- [ ] QR code display for sharing Harmony ID
- [ ] Contact list persistence in localStorage
- [ ] "Add friend by DID" — paste DID flow

### Rich Embeds

`link-preview.ts` exists (116 LOC) — fetches OpenGraph/meta tags.

- [ ] Render link previews inline in messages
- [ ] YouTube/Twitter/etc. special embed rendering
- [ ] Code block syntax highlighting

### Revenue / Cloud Tiers (beyond basic billing)

- [ ] Custom domain support for Pro tier
- [ ] SSO / enterprise features
- [ ] Admin dashboard for cloud instance management

### Migration Hardening

- [ ] GDPR: filter departed members from migration export
- [ ] Privacy notice template for admins
- [ ] Individual "my data" personal export (GDPR data portability)

### DID Method Expansion

- [ ] `did:web` support
- [ ] `did:plc` support
- [ ] Method-agnostic resolver architecture
